She was born and raised in Bloomington, holds degrees from Oberlin College and Boston University, and works as the fiscal officer and office manager for the Department of French and Italian at Indiana University.\r\n\r\nIsabel\'s interest in politics was spurred by the rapid development of Bloomington\'s green spaces in the 1990s. In 2002, she was actively engaged in the discussions regarding Bloomington\'s Growth Policies Plan and worked with the local Green Party to bring several amendment proposals to the Plan Commission. As the invasion of Iraq drew closer and the USA Patriot Act threatened the civil liberties of law-abiding citizens and residents, she took part in vigils as a member of the Bloomington Peace Action Coalition and helped to establish the Bloomington Bill of Rights Defense Committee.\r\n\r\nIn March 2003, she was appointed by the League of Women Voters to serve on the South Central Community Action Program board of directors. Through work on the board, including stints as secretary and treasurer, Isabel became familiar with the complicated funding process of the agency and the push to continually \"do more with less.\"\r\n\r\nIsabel served as a member of the Bloomington Environmental Commission (EC) from January 2004 through December 2007, as secretary/treasurer in 2005 and as chair in 2006. During her time as chair, the BEC laid the groundwork for the mayor to sign the US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, thus committing Bloomington to a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions. The BEC adopted a framework for implementing the principles of the Mayors agreement, and a committee of the BEC and the Commission on Sustainability will convert this framework into concrete steps each citizen can take to reduce emissions. In addition, the BEC gave significant input into the Unified Development Ordinance in 2006, working to ensure that future development has as little negative impact on our environment as possible.\r\n\r\nIsabel has also been an active leader at Indiana University, serving on the Bloomington Professional Staff Council 2002-2007 and as its president during the academic year 2005-06. In addition, she served on the IU Anti-Sweatshop Advisory Committee 2004-07. With the help of international non-profit groups, this organization tries to ensure that IU-licensed apparel is not made in sweatshop conditions. She was co-organizer of the 2005 conference \"The University and Fair Trade\" on the IU-Bloomington campus.\r\n\r\nIsabel\'s other community service activities include work with the Citizens Advisory Committee of the Metropolitan Planning Organization (transportation planning), Jobs With Justice (living wage and opposition to IU outsourcing), and Bloomington Transportation Options for People (alternative transportation).

Jackson','Bloomington','47404','Chris Sturbaum represents District One and his lived on Bloomington\'s west side for most of his life. Chris was Vice President of the Council in 2005 and Council President in 2006. Chris graduated from Wabash College and is the small business owner of \"Golden Hands Construction,\" a business dedicated to restoring historic properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince his tenure with the Council began in 2004, Chris has successfully introduced a number of policy initiatives to enhance the quality of life for everyone in Bloomington including: providing for demolition delay for historic structures, adding gender identity to the City\'s human rights protections, fostering social and economic sustainability through the City\'s new zoning laws, collaborating on the Downtown Plan, and working for affordable housing. Chris has served on the City\'s Plan Commission, the City\'s Economic Development Commission, the Historic Preservation Commission, the Board of the Urban Enterprise Association, Commission for the Bloomington Downtown and the Council\'s Sidewalk Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nChris\' continuing work to improve the quality of life for Bloomington residents includes the following. In his words:\r\n\r\n· JOBS are important for our community and our downtown vitality. Our community\'s distinctive character plays a big role in a business\'s decision to locate or stay in Bloomington.\r\n\r\n· TRANSIT. We must move traffic efficiently but not at the expense of bikes, pedestrians and livable neighborhoods. Our mass transit must improve and I am working with Council, the administration and staff in support of a downtown trolley in an effort to improve public transit ridership and to increase usage of existing parking structures.\r\n\r\n· ZONING changes inspired by Bloomington\'s Downtown Plan should stimulate good growth. Toward this end, the B-Line Trail will be a real positive change for the West Side.\r\n\r\n· SOCIAL JUSTICE is the reason I continue to push for more funding of affordable housing, along with incentives to build more units. Rebuilding our older neighborhoods while helping renters become owners must continue to be a goal of our local government.\r\n\r\n· HISTORY. The historic character of Bloomington is a distinctive feature of our community\'s character. I work with the City Council and the City\'s Historic Preservation Commission to protect our community\'s historic resources.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal government deals with many other issues affecting the everyday life of residents. The City Council is the voice for neighbors in our districts when something needs to be fixed. We work on alternative transportation, green yards, street lights, stop signs, over-occupancy of rentals, dogs, cats and neighborhood preservation to name just a few.\r\nYour ideas, phone calls and e-mails are always welcome!

The Bloomington Historic Preservation Commission sought this action and, after a public hearing on March 13th, 2008, recommended them to the Common Council based upon certain historic and architectural criteria set forth in Title 8 (Historic Preservation and Protection).  The conservation district is, in general, less restrictive than a full historic district, and only requires the review of proposals to demolish or move buildings or construct new principal or accessory buildings.

It fixes three scrivener’s errors, amends all required time limits to be timed as working days, rather than calendar days, and adds an appeal process for citizens aggrieved by the City’s notice of tree removal.  The new appeal process allows an aggrieved citizen to utilize the same appeal process that is in place for tree permit appeals and notice of violation appeals, both of which involve a public hearing.  The only difference is that an appeal of the City’s notice of tree removal must be made within seven working days, as opposed to the ten working days allowed for the other two appeals.  This time limit is shorter because an appeal made within seven working days of notice of tree removal will definitely be made before the City takes the tree down, as the City’s notice must be made at least ten working days before the tree is removed.
